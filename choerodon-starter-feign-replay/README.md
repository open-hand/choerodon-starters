# Choerodon Starter Fegin Replay

``choerodon-starter-feign-replay`` is an extension toolkit based on spring cloud ribbon, feign, and other components. The repository mainly solves the transfer of services through feign. The mutual transfer between various microservices in Choerodon are through feign, so each resource of Choerodon needs to add this dependency package.

## Feature

Implement the passing of token based on the latest ``shareSecurityContext``

## Requirements
Add the following configuration before joining the microservice that depends on the toolkit.

```
hystrix:
  shareSecurityContext: true
```

git clone https://github.com/choerodon/choerodon-starters.git	
```

## Note
This tool only passes tokens for oauth2 in Choerodon, and calls feign. If there is no security context, a token is generated based on the configured serviceAccount.

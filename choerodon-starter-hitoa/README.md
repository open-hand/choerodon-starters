# Hitoa Toolkit

The hitoa toolkit is used to collect the information of jvm while the microservice program is running.

## Feature

Add richer thread group monitoring capabilities to future plans.

## Requirements

References in `pom.xml` of microservices. 

```xml
<dependency>
    <groupId>io.choerodon</groupId>
    <artifactId>choerodon-starter-hitoa</artifactId>
     <version>0.9.1.RELEASE</version>
</dependency>
```

To start up the monitoring of prometheus.

## To get the code

```shell
git clone https://github.com/choerodon/choerodon-starters.git
cd choerodon-starter-hitoa
```
## Installation and Getting Started

Microservices can be monitored after being referenced.
## Documentation

1. Use the toolkit ``ofio.micrometer`` version ``1.0.2`` for the  collection of jvm information.
2. By using ``spring.factories``, the file is injected and the citation takes effect.
3. View the returned data information on the ``/prometheus`` endpoint of the program monitoring port that references the package.
4. Later iterations of the version may require changes to the version.

## Dependencies

- ``io.micrometer 1.0.2``

## Disable Hitoa

If you don't want this function, you can disable this by set following properties:

```yaml
hitoa:
  enabled: false
management:
  metrics:
    export:
      prometheus:
        enabled: false
    binders:
      jvm:
        enabled: false
      logback:
        enabled: false
      uptime:
        enabled: false
      processor:
        enabled: false
      files:
        enabled: false
```

And the endpoint `/premetheus`won't be found any more and the beans will not be created.

If you want to set just one property to disable it, maybe you should just copy those above to your application and make them read the property from a certain system environment variable like this:

```yaml
hitoa:
  enabled: ${enabled:true}
management:
  metrics:
    export:
      prometheus:
        enabled: ${enabled:true}
    binders:
      jvm:
        enabled: ${enabled:true}
      logback:
        enabled: ${enabled:true}
      uptime:
        enabled: ${enabled:true}
      processor:
        enabled: ${enabled:true}
      files:
        enabled: ${enabled:true}
```

And the property `hitoa.enabled` is to disable Hitoa configuration and the others are to disable the beans

and configurations from the dependency `micrometer-spring-legacy`.
